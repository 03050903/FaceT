The prime mission of the project was to develop an aesthetic and easy-to- use mobile app platform for enhancing women’s experience in shopping for cosmetic products. Different targets were set for each part when conducting the project.
It was designed according to the following seven objectives for providing a good User Experience:

(i) To ease users in finding out the cosmetic products which suit them best;

(ii) To locate retail stores selling concerned cosmetic products;

(iii) To help users understand the effects of the makeup products;

(iv) To provide a platform for users to share their views on different cosmetic products;

(v) To allow users’ contribution by letting them add new cosmetic products to the database; 

(vi) To minimize user’s actions for performing tasks.
